comment: "This command will allow you to run commands against a local Docker Container.
  You can run commands like wc for instance with word count, or other types of commands
  that you want on the docker container. \n\nWe recommend for tools that you want
  to use that are not part of the default Docker container, to cope this Automation
  script and then create a customer docker container with /docker_image_create with
  a custom docker container to add any command level tool to Demisto and output the
  results directly to the context."

outputs:
- contextPath: CommandResults.Command
  description: This will contain the command line tool name and arguments that were
    ran.
- contextPath: CommandResults.Results
  description: This will have the full results as a single string of the results.
    You will need to parse the results of the command into the format you want. Try
    looking at commands like ExtractRegex or create your own follow on automation
    script that will parse the results into the format you would like.
